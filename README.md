# Longitudinal Principal Manifold Estimation (LPME)

This project is intended to create a longitudinal extension of the Principal Manifold Estimation algorithm introduced in [Meng and Eloyan, 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35813449/). This extended algorithm is applied to simulation examples, and is also used with hippocampus data from structural MRI scans included in the ADNI dataset.

## Dependency installation:

Installing the `ANTsR` package should be done by following the command line instructions shown [here](https://antsx.github.io/ANTsR/). Using `devtools` to install from Github is not working at this time.
