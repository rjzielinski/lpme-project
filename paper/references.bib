  abstract = {Identification of ice floes and their outlines in satellite images is important for understanding physical processes in the polar regions, for transportation in ice-covered seas, and for the design of offshore structures intended to survive in the presence of ice. At present this is done manually, a long and tedious process that precludes full use of the great volume of relevant images now available. We describe an accurate and almost fully automatic method for identifying ice floes and their outlines. Floe outlines are modeled as closed principal curves, a flexible class of smooth nonparametric curves. We propose a robust method of estimating closed principal curves that reduces both bias and variance. Initial estimates of floe outlines come from the erosion-propagation (EP) algorithm, which combines erosion from mathematical morphology with local propagation of information about floe edges. The edge pixels from the EP algorithm are grouped into floe outlines using a new clustering algorithm. This extends existing clustering methods by allowing groups to be centered about principal curves rather than points or lines. This may open the way to efficient feature extraction using cluster analysis in images more generally. The method is implemented in an object-oriented programming environment, for which it is well suited, and is quite computationally efficient.},

The algorithm employs an adaptive bandwidth selection procedure which does not rely on prior knowledge of the underlying manifold. The obtained low-dimensional embeddings can be further utilized for downstream purposes such as data visualization, clustering and prediction. Our method is theoretically justified and practically interpretable. Specifically, for a general class of kernel functions, we establish the convergence of the final embeddings to their noiseless counterparts when the dimension grows polynomially with the size, and characterize the effect of the signal-to-noise ratio on the rate of convergence and phase transition. We also prove the convergence of the embeddings to the eigenfunctions of an integral operator defined by the kernel map of some reproducing kernel Hilbert space capturing the underlying nonlinear structures. Our results hold even when the dimension of the manifold grows with the sample size. Numerical simulations and analysis of real data sets show the superior empirical performance of the proposed method, compared to many existing methods, on learning various nonlinear manifolds in diverse applications.},

Vaguely speaking, a curve is said to pass through the middle of a dataset if every point on the curve is the average of the observations projecting onto it. This idea can be made precise by defining principal curves for probability densities. In this paper we study principal curves in the plane. Like linear principal components, principal curves are critical points of the expected squared distance from the data. However, the largest and smallest principal components are extrema of the distance, whereas all principal curves are saddle points. This explains why cross-validation does not appear to be a viable method for choosing the complexity of principal curve estimates.},

As a flexible class of nonlinear structures, it is common to focus on Riemannian manifolds. Most existing manifold learning algorithms replace the original data with lower dimensional coordinates without providing an estimate of the manifold in the observation space or using the manifold to denoise the original data. This article proposes a new methodology for addressing these problems, allowing interpolation of the estimated manifold between fitted data points. The proposed approach is motivated by novel theoretical properties of local covariance matrices constructed from noisy samples on a manifold. Our results enable us to turn a global manifold reconstruction problem into a local regression problem, allowing application of Gaussian processes for probabilistic manifold reconstruction. In addition to theory justifying the algorithm, we provide simulated and real data examples to illustrate the performance.},

  abstract = {What can be expected in normal aging, and where does normal aging stop and pathological neurodegeneration begin? With the slow progression of age-related dementias such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is difficult to distinguish age-related changes from effects of undetected disease. We review recent research on changes of the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus in aging and the borders between normal aging and AD. We argue that prominent cortical reductions are evident in fronto-temporal regions in elderly even with low probability of AD, including regions overlapping the default mode network. Importantly, these regions show high levels of amyloid deposition in AD, and are both structurally and functionally vulnerable early in the disease. This normalcy-pathology homology is critical to understand, since aging itself is the major risk factor for sporadic AD. Thus, rather than necessarily reflecting early signs of disease, these changes may be part of normal aging, and may inform on why the aging brain is so much more susceptible to AD than is the younger brain. We suggest that regions characterized by a high degree of life-long plasticity are vulnerable to detrimental effects of normal aging, and that this age-vulnerability renders them more susceptible to additional, pathological AD-related changes. We conclude that it will be difficult to understand AD without understanding why it preferably affects older brains, and that we need a model that accounts for age-related changes in AD-vulnerable regions independently of AD-pathology.},

In this article, we propose the keypoint-based visual imitation learning (K-VIL) approach that automatically extracts sparse, object-centric, and embodiment-independent task representations from a small number of human demonstration videos. The task representation is composed of keypoint-based geometric constraints on principal manifolds, their associated local frames, and the movement primitives that are then needed for the task execution. Our approach is capable of extracting such task representations from a single-demonstration video and of incrementally updating them when new demonstrations are available. To reproduce manipulation skills using the learned set of prioritized geometric constraints in novel scenes, we introduce a novel keypoint-based admittance controller. We evaluate our approach in several real-world applications, showcasing its ability to deal with cluttered scenes, viewpoint mismatch, new instances of categorical objects, and large object pose and shape variations. Our evaluation demonstrates the efficiency and robustness of our approach in both one-shot and few-shot imitation learning settings.},

  abstract = {Principal curves are smooth one-dimensional curves that pass through the middle of a p-dimensional data set, providing a nonlinear summary of the data. They are nonparametric, and their shape is suggested by the data. The algorithm for constructing principal curves starts with some prior summary, such as the usual principal-component line. The curve in each successive iteration is a smooth or local average of the p-dimensional points, where the definition of local is based on the distance in arc length of the projections of the points onto the curve found in the previous iteration. In this article principal curves are defined, an algorithm for their construction is given, some theoretical results are presented, and the procedure is compared to other generalizations of principal components. Two applications illustrate the use of principal curves. The first describes how the principal-curve procedure was used to align the magnets of the Stanford linear collider. The collider uses about 950 magnets in a roughly circular arrangement to bend electron and positron beams and bring them to collision. After construction, it was found that some of the magnets had ended up significantly out of place. As a result, the beams had to be bent too sharply and could not be focused. The engineers realized that the magnets did not have to be moved to their originally planned locations, but rather to a sufficiently smooth arc through the middle of the existing positions. This arc was found using the principal-curve procedure. In the second application, two different assays for gold content in several samples of computer-chip waste appear to show some systematic differences that are blurred by measurement error. The classical approach using linear errors in variables regression can detect systematic linear differences but is not able to account for nonlinearities. When the first linear principal component is replaced with a principal curve, a local ``bump'' is revealed, and bootstrapping is used to verify its presence.},

  abstract = {Euclidean statistics are often generalized to Riemannian manifolds by replacing straight-line interpolations with geodesic ones. While these Riemannian models are familiar-looking, they are restricted by the inflexibility of geodesics, and they rely on constructions which are optimal only in Euclidean domains. We consider extensions of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to Riemannian manifolds. Classic Riemannian approaches seek a geodesic curve passing through the mean that optimizes a criteria of interest. The requirements that the solution both is geodesic and must pass through the mean tend to imply that the methods only work well when the manifold is mostly flat within the support of the generating distribution. We argue that instead of generalizing linear Euclidean models, it is more fruitful to generalize non-linear Euclidean models. Specifically, we extend the classic Principal Curves from Hastie \& Stuetzle to data residing on a complete Riemannian manifold. We show that for elliptical distributions in the tangent of spaces of constant curvature, the standard principal geodesic is a principal curve. The proposed model is simple to compute and avoids many of the pitfalls of traditional geodesic approaches. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the Riemannian principal curves on several manifolds and datasets.},

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), (18F)-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET), urine serum, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, as well as clinical/psychometric assessments are acquiredat multiple time points. All data will be cross-linked and made available to the general scientific community. The purpose of this report is to describe the MRI methods employed in ADNI. The ADNI MRI core established specifications thatguided protocol development. A major effort was devoted toevaluating 3D T1-weighted sequences for morphometric analyses. Several options for this sequence were optimized for the relevant manufacturer platforms and then compared in a reduced-scale clinical trial. The protocol selected for the ADNI study includes: back-to-back 3D magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) scans; B1-calibration scans when applicable; and an axial proton density-T2 dual contrast (i.e., echo) fast spin echo/turbo spin echo (FSE/TSE) for pathology detection. ADNI MRI methods seek to maximize scientific utility while minimizing the burden placed on participants. The approach taken in ADNI to standardization across sites and platforms of the MRI protocol, postacquisition corrections, and phantom-based monitoring of all scanners could be used as a model for other multisite trials.

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible brain disorder. Hippocampus is one of the involved regions and its atrophy is a widely used biomarker for AD diagnosis. We have recently developed DenseCNN, a lightweight 3D deep convolutional network model, for AD classification based on hippocampus magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segments. In addition to the visual features of the hippocampus segments, the global shape representations of the hippocampus are also important for AD diagnosis. In this study, we propose DenseCNN2, a deep convolutional network model for AD classification by incorporating global shape representations along with hippocampus segmentations. The data was obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and was T1-weighted structural MRI from initial screening or baseline, including ADNI 1,2/GO and 3. DenseCNN2 was trained and evaluated with 326 AD subjects and 607 CN hippocampus MRI using 5-fold cross-validation strategy. DenseCNN2 was compared with other state-of-the-art machine learning approaches for the task of AD classification. We showed that DenseCNN2 with combined visual and global shape features performed better than deep learning models with visual or global shape features alone. DenseCNN2 achieved an average accuracy of 0.925, sensitivity of 0.882, specificity of 0.949, and area under curve (AUC) of 0.978, which are better than or comparable to the state-of-the-art methods in AD classification. Data visualization analysis through 2D embedding of UMAP confirmed that global shape features improved class discrimination between AD and normal. DenseCNN2, a lightweight 3D deep convolutional network model based on combined hippocampus segmentations and global shape features, achieved high performance and has potential as an efficient diagnostic tool for AD classification.},

  abstract = {Principal curves have been defined as "self-consistent" smooth curves which pass through the "middle" of a d-dimensional probability distribution or data cloud. They give a summary of the data and also serve as an efficient feature extraction tool. We take a new approach by defining principal curves as continuous curves of a given length which minimize the expected squared distance between the curve and points of the space randomly chosen according to a given distribution. The new definition makes it possible to theoretically analyze principal curve learning from training data and it also leads to a new practical construction. Our theoretical learning scheme chooses a curve from a class of polygonal lines with k segments and with a given total length to minimize the average squared distance over n training points drawn independently. Convergence properties of this learning scheme are analyzed and a practical version of this theoretical algorithm is implemented. In each iteration of the algorithm, a new vertex is added to the polygonal line and the positions of the vertices are updated so that they minimize a penalized squared distance criterion. Simulation results demonstrate that the new algorithm compares favorably with previous methods, both in terms of performance and computational complexity, and is more robust to varying data models.},

In vivo measurement of human hippocampal volume and shape with magnetic resonance imaging has become an important element of neuroimaging research. Nevertheless, volumetric findings are still inconsistent and controversial for many psychiatric conditions including affective disorders. Here we review the wealth of anatomical protocols for the delineation of the hippocampus in MR images, taking into consideration 71 different published protocols from the neuroimaging literature, with an emphasis on studies of affective disorders. We identified large variations between protocols in five major areas. 1) The inclusion/exclusion of hippocampal white matter (alveus and fimbria), 2) the definition of the anterior hippocampal--amygdala border, 3) the definition of the posterior border and the extent to which the hippocampal tail is included, 4) the definition of the inferior medial border of the hippocampus, and 5) the use of varying arbitrary lines. These are major sources of variance between different protocols. In contrast, the definitions of the lateral, superior, and inferior borders are less disputed. Directing resources to replication studies that incorporate characteristics of the segmentation protocols presented herein may help resolve seemingly contradictory volumetric results between prior neuroimaging studies and facilitate the appropriate selection of protocols for manual or automated delineation of the hippocampus for future research purposes.},

They have been widely studied over Euclidean spaces, where they are specified using covariance functions or covariograms for modelling complex dependencies. There is a growing literature on Gaussian processes over Riemannian manifolds in order to develop richer and more flexible inferential frameworks for non-Euclidean data. While numerical approximations through graph representations have been well studied for the Matern covariogram and heat kernel, the behaviour of asymptotic inference on the parameters of the covariogram has received relatively scant attention. We focus on asymptotic behaviour for Gaussian processes constructed over compact Riemannian manifolds. Building upon a recently introduced Matern covariogram on a compact Riemannian manifold, we employ formal notions and conditions for the equivalence of two Matern Gaussian random measures on compact manifolds to derive the parameter that is identifiable, also known as the microergodic parameter, and formally establish the consistency of the maximum likelihood estimate and the asymptotic optimality of the best linear unbiased predictor. The circle is studied as a specific example of compact Riemannian manifolds with numerical experiments to illustrate and corroborate the theory.},

In this paper, we perform Riemannian manifold learning in association with the statistical task of longitudinal trajectory analysis.

  abstract = {Background To measure hippocampal volume change in Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), expert manual delineation is often used because of its supposed accuracy. It has been suggested that expert outlining yields poorer reproducibility as compared to automated methods, but this has not been investigated. Aim To determine the reproducibilities of expert manual outlining and two common automated methods for measuring hippocampal atrophy rates in healthy aging, MCI and AD. Methods From the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), 80 subjects were selected: 20 patients with AD, 40 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 20 healthy controls (HCs). Left and right hippocampal volume change between baseline and month-12 visit was assessed by using expert manual delineation, and by the automated software packages FreeSurfer (longitudinal processing stream) and FIRST. To assess reproducibility of the measured hippocampal volume change, both back-to-back (BTB) MPRAGE scans available for each visit were analyzed. Hippocampal volume change was expressed in {$\mu$}L, and as a percentage of baseline volume. Reproducibility of the 1-year hippocampal volume change was estimated from the BTB measurements by using linear mixed model to calculate the limits of agreement (LoA) of each method, reflecting its measurement uncertainty. Using the delta method, approximate p-values were calculated for the pairwise comparisons between methods. Statistical analyses were performed both with inclusion and exclusion of visibly incorrect segmentations. Results Visibly incorrect automated segmentation in either one or both scans of a longitudinal scan pair occurred in 7.5\% of the hippocampi for FreeSurfer and in 6.9\% of the hippocampi for FIRST. After excluding these failed cases, reproducibility analysis for 1-year percentage volume change yielded LoA of {\textpm}7.2\% for FreeSurfer, {\textpm}9.7\% for expert manual delineation, and {\textpm}10.0\% for FIRST. Methods ranked the same for reproducibility of 1-year{$\mu$}L volume change, with LoA of {\textpm}218{$\mu$}L for FreeSurfer, {\textpm}319{$\mu$}L for expert manual delineation, and {\textpm}333{$\mu$}L for FIRST. Approximate p-values indicated that reproducibility was better for FreeSurfer than for manual or FIRST, and that manual and FIRST did not differ. Inclusion of failed automated segmentations led to worsening of reproducibility of both automated methods for 1-year raw and percentage volume change. Conclusion Quantitative reproducibility values of 1-year microliter and percentage hippocampal volume change were roughly similar between expert manual outlining, FIRST and FreeSurfer, but FreeSurfer reproducibility was statistically significantly superior to both manual outlining and FIRST after exclusion of failed segmentations.},

  abstract = {Automatic segmentation of subcortical structures in human brain MR images is an important but difficult task due to poor and variable intensity contrast. Clear, well-defined intensity features are absent in many places along typical structure boundaries and so extra information is required to achieve successful segmentation. A method is proposed here that uses manually labelled image data to provide anatomical training information. It utilises the principles of the Active Shape and Appearance Models but places them within a Bayesian framework, allowing probabilistic relationships between shape and intensity to be fully exploited. The model is trained for 15 different subcortical structures using 336 manually-labelled T1-weighted MR images. Using the Bayesian approach, conditional probabilities can be calculated easily and efficiently, avoiding technical problems of ill-conditioned covariance matrices, even with weak priors, and eliminating the need for fitting extra empirical scaling parameters, as is required in standard Active Appearance Models. Furthermore, differences in boundary vertex locations provide a direct, purely local measure of geometric change in structure between groups that, unlike voxel-based morphometry, is not dependent on tissue classification methods or arbitrary smoothing. In this paper the fully-automated segmentation method is presented and assessed both quantitatively, using Leave-One-Out testing on the 336 training images, and qualitatively, using an independent clinical dataset involving Alzheimer's disease. Median Dice overlaps between 0.7 and 0.9 are obtained with this method, which is comparable or better than other automated methods. An implementation of this method, called FIRST, is currently distributed with the freely-available FSL package.},

Functional imaging approaches such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) have been successfully employed to detect dopaminergic dysfunction in PD, even while at a preclinical stage, and to demonstrate the effects of therapies on function of intact dopaminergic neurons within the affected striatum. PET and SPECT can also monitor PD progression as reflected by changes in brain levodopa and glucose metabolism and dopamine transporter binding. Structural imaging approaches include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transcranial sonography (TCS). Recent advances in voxel-based morphometry and diffusion-weighted MRI have provided exciting potential applications for the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes. Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity, detected with TCS, may provide a marker of susceptibility to PD, probably reflecting disturbances of iron metabolism, but does not appear to correlate well with disease severity or change with disease progression. In the future novel radiotracers may help us assess the involvement of non-dopaminergic brain pathways in the pathology of both motor and non-motor complications in PD.},

  abstract = {Radiation therapy plays an essential role in the treatment of cancer. In radiation therapy, the ideal radiation doses are delivered to the observed tumor while not affecting neighboring normal tissues. In three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) scans, the contours of tumors and organs-at-risk (OARs) are often manually delineated by radiologists. The task is complicated and time-consuming, and the manually delineated results will be variable from different radiologists. We propose a semi-supervised contour detection algorithm, which firstly uses a few points of region of interest (ROI) as an approximate initialization. Then the data sequences are achieved by the closed polygonal line (CPL) algorithm, where the data sequences consist of the ordered projection indexes and the corresponding initial points. Finally, the smooth lung contour can be obtained, when the data sequences are trained by the backpropagation neural network model (BNNM). We use the private clinical dataset and the public Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) dataset to measure the accuracy of the presented method, respectively. To the private dataset, experimental results on the initial points which are as low as 15\% of the manually delineated points show that the Dice coefficient reaches up to 0.95 and the global error is as low as 1.47\,{\texttimes}\,10-2. The performance of the proposed algorithm is also better than the cubic spline interpolation (CSI) algorithm. While on the public LIDC-IDRI dataset, our method achieves superior segmentation performance with average Dice of 0.83.},

Most of earlier studies focused primarily on the hippocampus. Here, we assessed the accuracy of two widely used non-commercial programs (FSL-FIRST and Freesurfer) for segmenting the caudate and putamen. T1-weighted 1\,mm3 isotropic resolution MR images were acquired for thirty healthy subjects (15 females). Caudate nucleus and putamen were segmented manually by two independent observers and automatically by FIRST and Freesurfer (v4.5 and v5.3). Utilizing manual labels as reference standard the following measures were studied: Dice coefficient (D), percentage volume difference (PVD), absolute volume difference as well as intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for consistency and absolute agreement. For putamen segmentation, FIRST achieved higher D, lower PVD and higher ICC for absolute agreement with manual tracing than either version of Freesurfer. Freesurfer overestimated the putamen, while FIRST was not statistically different from manual tracing. The ICC for consistency with manual tracing was similar between the two methods. For caudate segmentation, FIRST and Freesurfer performed more similarly. In conclusion, Freesurfer and FIRST are not equivalent when comparing to manual tracing. FIRST was superior for putaminal segmentation.},

  abstract = {Parkinson disease is the second-most common neurodegenerative disorder that affects 2--3\% of the population {$\geq$}65 years of age. Neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, which causes striatal dopamine deficiency, and intracellular inclusions containing aggregates of {$\alpha$}-synuclein are the neuropathological hallmarks of Parkinson disease. Multiple other cell types throughout the central and peripheral autonomic nervous system are also involved, probably from early disease onwards. Although clinical diagnosis relies on the presence of bradykinesia and other cardinal motor features, Parkinson disease is associated with many non-motor symptoms that add to overall disability. The underlying molecular pathogenesis involves multiple pathways and mechanisms: {$\alpha$}-synuclein proteostasis, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, calcium homeostasis, axonal transport and neuroinflammation. Recent research into diagnostic biomarkers has taken advantage of neuroimaging in which several modalities, including PET, single-photon emission CT (SPECT) and novel MRI techniques, have been shown to aid early and differential diagnosis. Treatment of Parkinson disease is anchored on pharmacological substitution of striatal dopamine, in addition to non-dopaminergic approaches to address both motor and non-motor symptoms and deep brain stimulation for those developing intractable L-DOPA-related motor complications. Experimental therapies have tried to restore striatal dopamine by gene-based and cell-based approaches, and most recently, aggregation and cellular transport of {$\alpha$}-synuclein have become therapeutic targets. One of the greatest current challenges is to identify markers for prodromal disease stages, which would allow novel disease-modifying therapies to be started earlier.},

Furthermore, there is a growing appreciation of the potential utility of longitudinally acquired structural images and reliable image processing to evaluate disease modifying therapies. Challenges have been related to the variability that is inherent in the available cross-sectional processing tools, to the introduction of bias in longitudinal processing and to potential over-regularization. In this paper we introduce a novel longitudinal image processing framework, based on unbiased, robust, within-subject template creation, for automatic surface reconstruction and segmentation of brain MRI of arbitrarily many time points. We demonstrate that it is essential to treat all input images exactly the same as removing only interpolation asymmetries is not sufficient to remove processing bias. We successfully reduce variability and avoid over-regularization by initializing the processing in each time point with common information from the subject template. The presented results show a significant increase in precision and discrimination power while preserving the ability to detect large anatomical deviations; as such they hold great potential in clinical applications, e.g. allowing for smaller sample sizes or shorter trials to establish disease specific biomarkers or to quantify drug effects.},

The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.}

Cross-sectional and longitudinal estimates of atrophy rates were similar. We also found directional evidence of acceleration in atrophy rates with increasing age in all analyses, with the most marked changes occurring after 70 years of age. This increase in rates after 70 years of age was particularly marked in the ventricles (P\&lt;.001) and the hippocampi (P = .01).We found a significant age-associated decrease in global and regional brain volumes. Some evidence indicates that this decline in brain volumes may be due to a nonlinear acceleration in rates of atrophy with increasing age. A better understanding of this process may help to discriminate normal age-related changes from neurodegenerative diseases.Arch Neurol. 2003;60:989-994--{$>$}},

The key is designing a diffusion process on the dataset where the diffusion is done via a small subset called the landmark set. Roseland is theoretically justified under the manifold model, and its computational complexity is comparable with commonly applied subsampling scheme such as the Nystr{\"o}m extension. Specifically, when there are n data points in {$\mathbb{R}$}q and n{$\beta$} points in the landmark set, where {$\beta$} {$\in$} (0, 1), the computational complexity of Roseland is O(n1+2{$\beta$} + qn1+{$\beta$}), while that of Nystrom is O(n2.81{$\beta$} + qn1+2{$\beta$}). To demonstrate the potential of Roseland, we apply it to three datasets and compare it with several other existing algorithms. First, we apply Roseland to the task of spectral clustering using the MNIST dataset (70,000 images), achieving 85\% accuracy when the dataset is clean and 78\% accuracy when the dataset is noisy. Compared with other subsampling schemes, overall Roseland achieves a better performance. Second, we apply Roseland to the task of image segmentation using images from COCO. Finally, we demonstrate how to apply Roseland to explore long-term arterial blood pressure waveform dynamics during a liver transplant operation lasting for 12 hours. In conclusion, Roseland is scalable and robust, and it has a potential for analyzing large datasets.},

We explore this connection in two ways: (1) we propose an algorithm for finding principal manifolds that can be regularized in a variety of ways; and (2) we derive uniform convergence bounds and hence bounds on the learning rates of the algorithm. In particular, we give bounds on the covering numbers which allows us to obtain nearly optimal learning rates for certain types of regularization operators.

The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs---30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers---a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.}

The resolution of this issue has important implications for the design of therapeutic and investigative strategies. To this end we have used modern stereological techniques to compare the regional pattern of neuronal cell loss in the hippocampus related to normal ageing to that associated with Alzheimer's disease. The loss related to normal ageing was evaluated from estimates of the total number of neurons in each of the major hippocampal subdivisions of 45 normal ageing subjects who ranged in age from 13 to 101 years. The Alzheimer's disease related losses were evaluated from similar data obtained from 7 cases of Alzheimer's disease and 14 age matched controls. Qualitative differences were observed in the regional patterns of neuronal loss related to normal ageing and Alzheimer's disease. The most distinctive Alzheimer's disease related neuron loss was seen in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. In the normal ageing group there was almost no neuron loss in this region (final neuron count in the CA1 region: 4{$\cdot$}40 X 106 neurons for the Alzheimer's disease group vs 14{$\cdot$}08 {\texttimes} 106 neurons in the normal ageing group). It is concluded that the neurodegenerative processes associated with normal ageing and with Alzheimer's disease are qualitatively different and that Alzheimer's disease is not accelerated by ageing but is a distinct pathological process.},

The coordinates of each image in such a low-dimensional space captures information about structural shape and appearance and, when a phenotype exists, about the subject's clinical state. A key contribution is that we propose a method for incorporating longitudinal image information in the learned manifold. In particular, we compare simultaneously embedding baseline and follow-up scans into a single manifold with the combination of separate manifold representations for inter-subject and intra-subject variation. We apply the proposed methods to 362 subjects enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and classify healthy controls, subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Learning manifolds based on both the appearance and temporal change of the hippocampus, leads to correct classification rates comparable with those provided by state-of-the-art automatic segmentation estimates of hippocampal volume and atrophy. The biomarkers identified with the proposed method are data-driven and represent a potential alternative to a-priori defined biomarkers derived from manual or automated segmentations.},

  abstract = {Since its introduction in 2000, Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) has been widely applied in data science. We provide an asymptotical analysis of LLE under the manifold setup. We show that for a general manifold, asymptotically we may not obtain the Laplace--Beltrami operator, and the result may depend on nonuniform sampling unless a correct regularization is chosen. We also derive the corresponding kernel function, which indicates that LLE is not a Markov process. A comparison with other commonly applied nonlinear algorithms, particularly a diffusion map, is provided and its relationship with locally linear regression is also discussed.},

  abstract = {In this article, we are concerned with data generated from a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) experiment. The goal is to parameterize manifold-like white matter tracts, such as the corpus callosum, using principal surfaces. The problem is approached by finding a geometrically motivated surface-based representation of the corpus callosum and visualized fractional anisotropy (FA) values projected onto the surface. The method also applies to any other diffusion summary. An algorithm is proposed that (a) constructs the principal surface of a corpus callosum; (b) flattens the surface into a parametric two-dimensional (2D) map; and (c) projects associated FA values on the map. The algorithm is applied to a longitudinal study containing 466 diffusion tensor images of 176 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients observed at multiple visits. For each subject and visit, the study contains a registered DTI scan of the corpus callosum at roughly 20,000 voxels. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate fast convergence and robust performance of the algorithm under a variety of challenging scenarios.},
