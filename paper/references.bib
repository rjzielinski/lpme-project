  abstract = {Manual tracing of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents the gold standard for segmentation in clinical neuropsychiatric research studies, however automated approaches are increasingly used due to its time limitations. The accuracy of segmentation techniques for subcortical structures has not been systematically investigated in large samples. We compared the accuracy of fully automated [(i) model-based: FSL-FIRST; (ii) patch-based: volBrain], semi--automated (FreeSurfer) and stereological (Measure{\textregistered}) segmentation techniques with manual tracing (ITK-SNAP) for delineating volumes of the caudate (easy-to-segment) and the hippocampus (difficult-to-segment). High resolution 1.5~T T1-weighted MR images were obtained from 177 patients with major psychiatric disorders and 104 healthy participants. The relative consistency (partial correlation), absolute agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC) and potential technique bias (Bland--Altman plots) of each technique was compared with manual segmentation. Each technique yielded high correlations (0.77--0.87, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001) and moderate ICC's (0.28--0.49) relative to manual segmentation for the caudate. For the hippocampus, stereology yielded good consistency (0.52--0.55, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001) and ICC (0.47--0.49), whereas automated and semi-automated techniques yielded poor ICC (0.07--0.10) and moderate consistency (0.35--0.62, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001). Bias was least using stereology for segmentation of the hippocampus and using FreeSurfer for segmentation of the caudate. In a typical neuropsychiatric MRI dataset, automated segmentation techniques provide good accuracy for an easy-to-segment structure such as the caudate, whereas for the hippocampus, a reasonable correlation with volume but poor absolute agreement was demonstrated. This indicates manual or stereological volume estimation should be considered for studies that require high levels of precision such as those with small sample size.},

At present this is done manually, a long and tedious process that precludes full use of the great volume of relevant images now available. We describe an accurate and almost fully automatic method for identifying ice floes and their outlines. Floe outlines are modeled as closed principal curves, a flexible class of smooth nonparametric curves. We propose a robust method of estimating closed principal curves that reduces both bias and variance. Initial estimates of floe outlines come from the erosion-propagation (EP) algorithm, which combines erosion from mathematical morphology with local propagation of information about floe edges. The edge pixels from the EP algorithm are grouped into floe outlines using a new clustering algorithm. This extends existing clustering methods by allowing groups to be centered about principal curves rather than points or lines. This may open the way to efficient feature extraction using cluster analysis in images more generally. The method is implemented in an object-oriented programming environment, for which it is well suited, and is quite computationally efficient.},

  abstract = {Purpose Precise and reproducible hippocampus outlining is important to quantify hippocampal atrophy caused by neurodegenerative diseases and to spare the hippocampus in whole brain radiation therapy when performing prophylactic cranial irradiation or treating brain metastases. This study aimed to quantify systematic differences between methods by comparing regional volume and outline reproducibility of manual, FSL-FIRST and FreeSurfer hippocampus segmentations. Materials and methods This study used a dataset from ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative), including 20 healthy controls, 40 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 20 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). For each subject back-to-back (BTB) T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE images were acquired at time-point baseline (BL) and 12 months later (M12). Hippocampi segmentations of all methods were converted into triangulated meshes, regional volumes were extracted and regional Jaccard indices were computed between the hippocampi meshes of paired BTB scans to evaluate reproducibility. Regional volumes and Jaccard indices were modelled as a function of group (G), method (M), hemisphere (H), time-point (T), region (R) and interactions. Results For the volume data the model selection procedure yielded the following significant main effects G, M, H, T and R and interaction effects G-R and M-R. The same model was found for the BTB scans. For all methods volumes reduces with the severity of disease. Significant fixed effects for the regional Jaccard index data were M, R and the interaction M-R. For all methods the middle region was most reproducible, independent of diagnostic group. FSL-FIRST was most and FreeSurfer least reproducible. Discussion/Conclusion A novel method to perform detailed analysis of subtle differences in hippocampus segmentation is proposed. The method showed that hippocampal segmentation reproducibility was best for FSL-FIRST and worst for Freesurfer. We also found systematic regional differences in hippocampal segmentation between different methods reinforcing the need of adopting harmonized protocols.},

  abstract = {The human hippocampus is vulnerable to a range of degenerative conditions and as such, accurate in vivo measurement of the hippocampus and hippocampal substructures via neuroimaging is of great interest for understanding mechanisms of disease as well as for use as a biomarker in clinical trials of novel therapeutics. Although total hippocampal volume can be measured relatively reliably, it is critical to understand how this reliability is affected by acquisition on different scanners, as multiple scanning platforms would likely be utilized in large-scale clinical trials. This is particularly true for hippocampal subregional measurements, which have only relatively recently been measurable through common image processing platforms such as FreeSurfer. Accurate segmentation of these subregions is challenging due to their small size, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal loss in medial temporal regions of the brain, and lack of contrast for delineation from standard neuroimaging procedures. Here, we assess the test-retest reliability of the FreeSurfer automated hippocampal subfield segmentation procedure using two Siemens model scanners (a Siemens Trio and Prismafit Trio upgrade). T1-weighted images were acquired for 11 generally healthy younger participants (two scans on the Trio and one scan on the Prismafit). Each scan was processed through the standard cross-sectional stream and the recently released longitudinal pipeline in FreeSurfer v6.0 for hippocampal segmentation. Test-retest reliability of the volumetric measures was examined for individual subfields as well as percent volume difference and Dice overlap among scans and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). Reliability was high in the molecular layer, dentate gyrus, and whole hippocampus with the inclusion of three time points with mean volume differences among scans less than 3\%, overlap greater than 80\%, and ICC {$>$}0.95. The parasubiculum and hippocampal fissure showed the least improvement in reliability with mean volume difference greater than 5\%, overlap less than 70\%, and ICC scores ranging from 0.78 to 0.89. Other subregions, including the CA regions, were stable in their mean volume difference and overlap ({$<$}5\% difference and {$>$}75\% respectively) and showed improvement in reliability with the inclusion of three scans (ICC~\hspace{0pt}{$>~$}\hspace{0pt}0.9). Reliability was generally higher within scanner (Trio-Trio), however, Trio-Prismafit reliability was also high and did not exhibit an obvious bias. These results suggest that the FreeSurfer automated segmentation procedure is a reliable method to measure total as well as hippocampal subregional volumes and may be useful in clinical applications including as an endpoint for future clinical trials of conditions affecting the hippocampus.},

Nonlinear dimensionality-reduction methods such as uniform manifold approximation and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding have been used for high-throughput biomedical data. However, they have not been used extensively for brain activity data such as those from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), primarily due to their inability to maintain dynamic structure. Here we introduce a nonlinear manifold learning method for time-series data---including those from fMRI---called temporal potential of heat-diffusion for affinity-based transition embedding (T-PHATE). In addition to recovering a low-dimensional intrinsic manifold geometry from time-series data, T-PHATE exploits the data's autocorrelative structure to faithfully denoise and unveil dynamic trajectories. We empirically validate T-PHATE on three fMRI datasets, showing that it greatly improves data visualization, classification, and segmentation of the data relative to several other state-of-the-art dimensionality-reduction benchmarks. These improvements suggest many potential applications of T-PHATE to other high-dimensional datasets of temporally diffuse processes.},

The algorithm employs an adaptive bandwidth selection procedure which does not rely on prior knowledge of the underlying manifold. The obtained low-dimensional embeddings can be further utilized for downstream purposes such as data visualization, clustering and prediction. Our method is theoretically justified and practically interpretable. Specifically, for a general class of kernel functions, we establish the convergence of the final embeddings to their noiseless counterparts when the dimension grows polynomially with the size, and characterize the effect of the signal-to-noise ratio on the rate of convergence and phase transition. We also prove the convergence of the embeddings to the eigenfunctions of an integral operator defined by the kernel map of some reproducing kernel Hilbert space capturing the underlying nonlinear structures. Our results hold even when the dimension of the manifold grows with the sample size. Numerical simulations and analysis of real data sets show the superior empirical performance of the proposed method, compared to many existing methods, on learning various nonlinear manifolds in diverse applications.},

Vaguely speaking, a curve is said to pass through the middle of a dataset if every point on the curve is the average of the observations projecting onto it. This idea can be made precise by defining principal curves for probability densities. In this paper we study principal curves in the plane. Like linear principal components, principal curves are critical points of the expected squared distance from the data. However, the largest and smallest principal components are extrema of the distance, whereas all principal curves are saddle points. This explains why cross-validation does not appear to be a viable method for choosing the complexity of principal curve estimates.},

As a flexible class of nonlinear structures, it is common to focus on Riemannian manifolds. Most existing manifold learning algorithms replace the original data with lower dimensional coordinates without providing an estimate of the manifold in the observation space or using the manifold to denoise the original data. This article proposes a new methodology for addressing these problems, allowing interpolation of the estimated manifold between fitted data points. The proposed approach is motivated by novel theoretical properties of local covariance matrices constructed from noisy samples on a manifold. Our results enable us to turn a global manifold reconstruction problem into a local regression problem, allowing application of Gaussian processes for probabilistic manifold reconstruction. In addition to theory justifying the algorithm, we provide simulated and real data examples to illustrate the performance.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and brain volumetry allow for the quantification of changes in brain volume using automatic algorithms which are widely used in both, clinical and scientific studies. However, studies comparing the reliability of these programmes are scarce and mainly involved MRI derived from younger healthy controls. This study evaluates the reliability of frequently used segmentation programmes (SPM, FreeSurfer, FSL) using a realistic digital brain phantom and MRI brain acquisitions from patients with manifest Alzheimer's disease (AD, n=34), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n=60), and healthy subjects (n=32) matched for age and sex. Analysis of the brain phantom dataset demonstrated that SPM, FSL and FreeSurfer underestimate grey matter and overestimate white matter volumes with increasing noise. FreeSurfer calculated overall smaller brain volumes with increasing noise. Image inhomogeneity had only minor, non- significant effects on the results obtained with SPM and FreeSurfer 5.1, but had effects on the FSL results (increased white matter volumes with decreased grey matter volumes). The analysis of the patient data yielded decreasing volumes of grey and white matter with progression of brain atrophy independent of the method used. FreeSurfer calculated the largest grey matter and the smallest white matter volumes. FSL calculated the smallest grey matter volumes; SPM the largest white matter volumes. Best results are obtained with good image quality. With poor image quality, especially noise, SPM provides the best segmentation results. An optimised template for segmentation had no significant effect on segmentation results. While our findings underline the applicability of the programmes investigated, SPM may be the programme of choice when MRIs with limited image quality or brain images of elderly should be analysed.},

  abstract = {What can be expected in normal aging, and where does normal aging stop and pathological neurodegeneration begin? With the slow progression of age-related dementias such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is difficult to distinguish age-related changes from effects of undetected disease. We review recent research on changes of the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus in aging and the borders between normal aging and AD. We argue that prominent cortical reductions are evident in fronto-temporal regions in elderly even with low probability of AD, including regions overlapping the default mode network. Importantly, these regions show high levels of amyloid deposition in AD, and are both structurally and functionally vulnerable early in the disease. This normalcy-pathology homology is critical to understand, since aging itself is the major risk factor for sporadic AD. Thus, rather than necessarily reflecting early signs of disease, these changes may be part of normal aging, and may inform on why the aging brain is so much more susceptible to AD than is the younger brain. We suggest that regions characterized by a high degree of life-long plasticity are vulnerable to detrimental effects of normal aging, and that this age-vulnerability renders them more susceptible to additional, pathological AD-related changes. We conclude that it will be difficult to understand AD without understanding why it preferably affects older brains, and that we need a model that accounts for age-related changes in AD-vulnerable regions independently of AD-pathology.},

  abstract = {Visual imitation learning provides efficient and intuitive solutions for robotic systems to acquire novel manipulation skills. However, simultaneously learning geometric task constraints and control policies from visual inputs alone remains a challenging problem. In this article, we propose the keypoint-based visual imitation learning (K-VIL) approach that automatically extracts sparse, object-centric, and embodiment-independent task representations from a small number of human demonstration videos. The task representation is composed of keypoint-based geometric constraints on principal manifolds, their associated local frames, and the movement primitives that are then needed for the task execution. Our approach is capable of extracting such task representations from a single-demonstration video and of incrementally updating them when new demonstrations are available. To reproduce manipulation skills using the learned set of prioritized geometric constraints in novel scenes, we introduce a novel keypoint-based admittance controller. We evaluate our approach in several real-world applications, showcasing its ability to deal with cluttered scenes, viewpoint mismatch, new instances of categorical objects, and large object pose and shape variations. Our evaluation demonstrates the efficiency and robustness of our approach in both one-shot and few-shot imitation learning settings.},

  abstract = {Automated segmentation of the amygdala and the hippocampus is of interest for research looking at large datasets where manual segmentation of T1-weighted magnetic resonance tomography images is less feasible for morphometric analysis. Manual segmentation still remains the gold standard for subcortical structures like the hippocampus and the amygdala. A direct comparison of VBM8 and Freesurfer is rarely done, because VBM8 results are most often used for voxel-based analysis. We used the same region-of-interest (ROI) for Freesurfer and VBM8 to relate automated and manually derived volumes of the amygdala and the hippocampus. We processed a large manually segmented dataset of n=92 independent samples with an automated segmentation strategy (VBM8 vs. Freesurfer Version 5.0). For statistical analysis, we only calculated Pearsons's correlation coefficients, but used methods developed for comparison such as Lin's concordance coefficient. The correlation between automatic and manual segmentation was high for the hippocampus [0.58--0.76] and lower for the amygdala [0.45--0.59]. However, concordance coefficients point to higher concordance for the amygdala [0.46--0.62] instead of the hippocampus [0.06--0.12]. VBM8 and Freesurfer segmentation performed on a comparable level in comparison to manual segmentation. We conclude (1) that correlation alone does not capture systematic differences (e.g. of hippocampal volumes), (2) calculation of ROI volumes with VBM8 gives measurements comparable to Freesurfer V5.0 when using the same ROI and (3) systematic and proportional differences are caused mainly by different definitions of anatomic boundaries and only to a lesser part by different segmentation strategies. This work underscores the importance of using method comparison techniques and demonstrates that even with high correlation coefficients, there can be still large differences in absolute volume.},

  abstract = {Principal curves are smooth one-dimensional curves that pass through the middle of a p-dimensional data set, providing a nonlinear summary of the data. They are nonparametric, and their shape is suggested by the data. The algorithm for constructing principal curves starts with some prior summary, such as the usual principal-component line. The curve in each successive iteration is a smooth or local average of the p-dimensional points, where the definition of local is based on the distance in arc length of the projections of the points onto the curve found in the previous iteration. In this article principal curves are defined, an algorithm for their construction is given, some theoretical results are presented, and the procedure is compared to other generalizations of principal components. Two applications illustrate the use of principal curves. The first describes how the principal-curve procedure was used to align the magnets of the Stanford linear collider. The collider uses about 950 magnets in a roughly circular arrangement to bend electron and positron beams and bring them to collision. After construction, it was found that some of the magnets had ended up significantly out of place. As a result, the beams had to be bent too sharply and could not be focused. The engineers realized that the magnets did not have to be moved to their originally planned locations, but rather to a sufficiently smooth arc through the middle of the existing positions. This arc was found using the principal-curve procedure. In the second application, two different assays for gold content in several samples of computer-chip waste appear to show some systematic differences that are blurred by measurement error. The classical approach using linear errors in variables regression can detect systematic linear differences but is not able to account for nonlinearities. When the first linear principal component is replaced with a principal curve, a local ``bump'' is revealed, and bootstrapping is used to verify its presence.},

  abstract = {Euclidean statistics are often generalized to Riemannian manifolds by replacing straight-line interpolations with geodesic ones. While these Riemannian models are familiar-looking, they are restricted by the inflexibility of geodesics, and they rely on constructions which are optimal only in Euclidean domains. We consider extensions of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to Riemannian manifolds. Classic Riemannian approaches seek a geodesic curve passing through the mean that optimizes a criteria of interest. The requirements that the solution both is geodesic and must pass through the mean tend to imply that the methods only work well when the manifold is mostly flat within the support of the generating distribution. We argue that instead of generalizing linear Euclidean models, it is more fruitful to generalize non-linear Euclidean models. Specifically, we extend the classic Principal Curves from Hastie \& Stuetzle to data residing on a complete Riemannian manifold. We show that for elliptical distributions in the tangent of spaces of constant curvature, the standard principal geodesic is a principal curve. The proposed model is simple to compute and avoids many of the pitfalls of traditional geodesic approaches. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the Riemannian principal curves on several manifolds and datasets.},

All data will be cross-linked and made available to the general scientific community. The purpose of this report is to describe the MRI methods employed in ADNI. The ADNI MRI core established specifications thatguided protocol development. A major effort was devoted toevaluating 3D T1-weighted sequences for morphometric analyses. Several options for this sequence were optimized for the relevant manufacturer platforms and then compared in a reduced-scale clinical trial. The protocol selected for the ADNI study includes: back-to-back 3D magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) scans; B1-calibration scans when applicable; and an axial proton density-T2 dual contrast (i.e., echo) fast spin echo/turbo spin echo (FSE/TSE) for pathology detection. ADNI MRI methods seek to maximize scientific utility while minimizing the burden placed on participants. The approach taken in ADNI to standardization across sites and platforms of the MRI protocol, postacquisition corrections, and phantom-based monitoring of all scanners could be used as a model for other multisite trials.

As projects grow in scale with hundreds, even thousands, of individual participants and scans collected, quantification of brain structures by automated algorithms is becoming the only truly tractable approach. Here, we assessed the spatial and numerical reliability for newly deployed automated segmentation of hippocampal subfields and amygdala nuclei in FreeSurfer 7. In a sample of participants with repeated structural imaging scans (N\,=\,928), we found numerical reliability (as assessed by intraclass correlations, ICCs) was reasonable. Approximately 95\% of hippocampal subfields had ``excellent'' numerical reliability (ICCs\,{$\geq$}\,0.90), while only 67\% of amygdala subnuclei met this same threshold. In terms of spatial reliability, 58\% of hippocampal subfields and 44\% of amygdala subnuclei had Dice coefficients\,{$\geq$}\,0.70. Notably, multiple regions had poor numerical and/or spatial reliability. We also examined correlations between spatial reliability and person-level factors (e.g., participant age; T1 image quality). Both sex and image scan quality were related to variations in spatial reliability metrics. Examined collectively, our work suggests caution should be exercised for a few hippocampal subfields and amygdala nuclei with more variable reliability.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible brain disorder. Hippocampus is one of the involved regions and its atrophy is a widely used biomarker for AD diagnosis. We have recently developed DenseCNN, a lightweight 3D deep convolutional network model, for AD classification based on hippocampus magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segments. In addition to the visual features of the hippocampus segments, the global shape representations of the hippocampus are also important for AD diagnosis. In this study, we propose DenseCNN2, a deep convolutional network model for AD classification by incorporating global shape representations along with hippocampus segmentations. The data was obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and was T1-weighted structural MRI from initial screening or baseline, including ADNI 1,2/GO and 3. DenseCNN2 was trained and evaluated with 326 AD subjects and 607 CN hippocampus MRI using 5-fold cross-validation strategy. DenseCNN2 was compared with other state-of-the-art machine learning approaches for the task of AD classification. We showed that DenseCNN2 with combined visual and global shape features performed better than deep learning models with visual or global shape features alone. DenseCNN2 achieved an average accuracy of 0.925, sensitivity of 0.882, specificity of 0.949, and area under curve (AUC) of 0.978, which are better than or comparable to the state-of-the-art methods in AD classification. Data visualization analysis through 2D embedding of UMAP confirmed that global shape features improved class discrimination between AD and normal. DenseCNN2, a lightweight 3D deep convolutional network model based on combined hippocampus segmentations and global shape features, achieved high performance and has potential as an efficient diagnostic tool for AD classification.},

The new definition makes it possible to theoretically analyze principal curve learning from training data and it also leads to a new practical construction. Our theoretical learning scheme chooses a curve from a class of polygonal lines with k segments and with a given total length to minimize the average squared distance over n training points drawn independently. Convergence properties of this learning scheme are analyzed and a practical version of this theoretical algorithm is implemented. In each iteration of the algorithm, a new vertex is added to the polygonal line and the positions of the vertices are updated so that they minimize a penalized squared distance criterion. Simulation results demonstrate that the new algorithm compares favorably with previous methods, both in terms of performance and computational complexity, and is more robust to varying data models.},

AD is a genetic and sporadic neurodegenerative disease that causes an amnestic cognitive impairment in its prototypical presentation and non-amnestic cognitive impairment in its less common variants. AD is a common cause of cognitive impairment acquired in midlife and late-life but its clinical impact is modified by other neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular conditions. This Primer conceives of AD biology as the brain disorder that results from a complex interplay of loss of synaptic homeostasis and dysfunction in the highly interrelated endosomal/lysosomal clearance pathways in which the precursors, aggregated species and post-translationally modified products of A{$\beta$} and tau play important roles. Therapeutic endeavours are still struggling to find targets within this framework that substantially change the clinical course in persons with AD.},

In vivo measurement of human hippocampal volume and shape with magnetic resonance imaging has become an important element of neuroimaging research. Nevertheless, volumetric findings are still inconsistent and controversial for many psychiatric conditions including affective disorders. Here we review the wealth of anatomical protocols for the delineation of the hippocampus in MR images, taking into consideration 71 different published protocols from the neuroimaging literature, with an emphasis on studies of affective disorders. We identified large variations between protocols in five major areas. 1) The inclusion/exclusion of hippocampal white matter (alveus and fimbria), 2) the definition of the anterior hippocampal--amygdala border, 3) the definition of the posterior border and the extent to which the hippocampal tail is included, 4) the definition of the inferior medial border of the hippocampus, and 5) the use of varying arbitrary lines. These are major sources of variance between different protocols. In contrast, the definitions of the lateral, superior, and inferior borders are less disputed. Directing resources to replication studies that incorporate characteristics of the segmentation protocols presented herein may help resolve seemingly contradictory volumetric results between prior neuroimaging studies and facilitate the appropriate selection of protocols for manual or automated delineation of the hippocampus for future research purposes.},

They have been widely studied over Euclidean spaces, where they are specified using covariance functions or covariograms for modelling complex dependencies. There is a growing literature on Gaussian processes over Riemannian manifolds in order to develop richer and more flexible inferential frameworks for non-Euclidean data. While numerical approximations through graph representations have been well studied for the Matern covariogram and heat kernel, the behaviour of asymptotic inference on the parameters of the covariogram has received relatively scant attention. We focus on asymptotic behaviour for Gaussian processes constructed over compact Riemannian manifolds. Building upon a recently introduced Matern covariogram on a compact Riemannian manifold, we employ formal notions and conditions for the equivalence of two Matern Gaussian random measures on compact manifolds to derive the parameter that is identifiable, also known as the microergodic parameter, and formally establish the consistency of the maximum likelihood estimate and the asymptotic optimality of the best linear unbiased predictor. The circle is studied as a specific example of compact Riemannian manifolds with numerical experiments to illustrate and corroborate the theory.},

In this study, the accuracy of two automated segmentation tools, FSL-FIRST (with three different boundary correction settings) and FreeSurfer, were compared against manual segmentation of the hippocampus and subcortical nuclei, including the amygdala, thalamus, putamen, globus pallidus, caudate and nucleus accumbens, using volumetric and correlation analyses in 80 5-year-olds. Both FSL-FIRST and FreeSurfer overestimated the volume on all structures except the caudate, and the accuracy varied depending on the structure. Small structures such as the amygdala and nucleus accumbens, which are visually difficult to distinguish, produced significant overestimations and weaker correlations with all automated methods. Larger and more readily distinguishable structures such as the caudate and putamen produced notably lower overestimations and stronger correlations. Overall, the segmentations performed by FSL-FIRST's default pipeline were the most accurate, whereas FreeSurfer's results were weaker across the structures. In line with prior studies, the accuracy of automated segmentation tools was imperfect with respect to manually defined structures. However, apart from amygdala and nucleus accumbens, FSL-FIRST's agreement could be considered satisfactory (Pearson correlation {$>$} 0.74, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) {$>$} 0.68 and Dice score coefficient (DSC) {$>$} 0.87) with highest values for the striatal structures (putamen, globus pallidus, caudate) (Pearson correlation {$>$} 0.77, ICC {$>$} 0.87 and DSC {$>$} 0.88, respectively). Overall, automated segmentation tools do not always provide satisfactory results, and careful visual inspection of the automated segmentations is strongly advised.},

When dealing with high-dimensional or complex data, it is in general not possible to design a Riemannian geometry of relevance. In this paper, we perform Riemannian manifold learning in association with the statistical task of longitudinal trajectory analysis. After inference, we obtain both a submanifold of observations and a Riemannian metric so that the observed progressions are geodesics. This is achieved using a deep generative network, which maps trajectories in a low-dimensional Euclidean space to the observation space.},

  abstract = {Background To measure hippocampal volume change in Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), expert manual delineation is often used because of its supposed accuracy. It has been suggested that expert outlining yields poorer reproducibility as compared to automated methods, but this has not been investigated. Aim To determine the reproducibilities of expert manual outlining and two common automated methods for measuring hippocampal atrophy rates in healthy aging, MCI and AD. Methods From the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), 80 subjects were selected: 20 patients with AD, 40 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 20 healthy controls (HCs). Left and right hippocampal volume change between baseline and month-12 visit was assessed by using expert manual delineation, and by the automated software packages FreeSurfer (longitudinal processing stream) and FIRST. To assess reproducibility of the measured hippocampal volume change, both back-to-back (BTB) MPRAGE scans available for each visit were analyzed. Hippocampal volume change was expressed in {$\mu$}L, and as a percentage of baseline volume. Reproducibility of the 1-year hippocampal volume change was estimated from the BTB measurements by using linear mixed model to calculate the limits of agreement (LoA) of each method, reflecting its measurement uncertainty. Using the delta method, approximate p-values were calculated for the pairwise comparisons between methods. Statistical analyses were performed both with inclusion and exclusion of visibly incorrect segmentations. Results Visibly incorrect automated segmentation in either one or both scans of a longitudinal scan pair occurred in 7.5\% of the hippocampi for FreeSurfer and in 6.9\% of the hippocampi for FIRST. After excluding these failed cases, reproducibility analysis for 1-year percentage volume change yielded LoA of {\textpm}7.2\% for FreeSurfer, {\textpm}9.7\% for expert manual delineation, and {\textpm}10.0\% for FIRST. Methods ranked the same for reproducibility of 1-year{$\mu$}L volume change, with LoA of {\textpm}218{$\mu$}L for FreeSurfer, {\textpm}319{$\mu$}L for expert manual delineation, and {\textpm}333{$\mu$}L for FIRST. Approximate p-values indicated that reproducibility was better for FreeSurfer than for manual or FIRST, and that manual and FIRST did not differ. Inclusion of failed automated segmentations led to worsening of reproducibility of both automated methods for 1-year raw and percentage volume change. Conclusion Quantitative reproducibility values of 1-year microliter and percentage hippocampal volume change were roughly similar between expert manual outlining, FIRST and FreeSurfer, but FreeSurfer reproducibility was statistically significantly superior to both manual outlining and FIRST after exclusion of failed segmentations.},

  abstract = {Automatic segmentation of subcortical structures in human brain MR images is an important but difficult task due to poor and variable intensity contrast. Clear, well-defined intensity features are absent in many places along typical structure boundaries and so extra information is required to achieve successful segmentation. A method is proposed here that uses manually labelled image data to provide anatomical training information. It utilises the principles of the Active Shape and Appearance Models but places them within a Bayesian framework, allowing probabilistic relationships between shape and intensity to be fully exploited. The model is trained for 15 different subcortical structures using 336 manually-labelled T1-weighted MR images. Using the Bayesian approach, conditional probabilities can be calculated easily and efficiently, avoiding technical problems of ill-conditioned covariance matrices, even with weak priors, and eliminating the need for fitting extra empirical scaling parameters, as is required in standard Active Appearance Models. Furthermore, differences in boundary vertex locations provide a direct, purely local measure of geometric change in structure between groups that, unlike voxel-based morphometry, is not dependent on tissue classification methods or arbitrary smoothing. In this paper the fully-automated segmentation method is presented and assessed both quantitatively, using Leave-One-Out testing on the 336 training images, and qualitatively, using an independent clinical dataset involving Alzheimer's disease. Median Dice overlaps between 0.7 and 0.9 are obtained with this method, which is comparable or better than other automated methods. An implementation of this method, called FIRST, is currently distributed with the freely-available FSL package.},

Functional imaging approaches such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) have been successfully employed to detect dopaminergic dysfunction in PD, even while at a preclinical stage, and to demonstrate the effects of therapies on function of intact dopaminergic neurons within the affected striatum. PET and SPECT can also monitor PD progression as reflected by changes in brain levodopa and glucose metabolism and dopamine transporter binding. Structural imaging approaches include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transcranial sonography (TCS). Recent advances in voxel-based morphometry and diffusion-weighted MRI have provided exciting potential applications for the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes. Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity, detected with TCS, may provide a marker of susceptibility to PD, probably reflecting disturbances of iron metabolism, but does not appear to correlate well with disease severity or change with disease progression. In the future novel radiotracers may help us assess the involvement of non-dopaminergic brain pathways in the pathology of both motor and non-motor complications in PD.},

  abstract = {Radiation therapy plays an essential role in the treatment of cancer. In radiation therapy, the ideal radiation doses are delivered to the observed tumor while not affecting neighboring normal tissues. In three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) scans, the contours of tumors and organs-at-risk (OARs) are often manually delineated by radiologists. The task is complicated and time-consuming, and the manually delineated results will be variable from different radiologists. We propose a semi-supervised contour detection algorithm, which firstly uses a few points of region of interest (ROI) as an approximate initialization. Then the data sequences are achieved by the closed polygonal line (CPL) algorithm, where the data sequences consist of the ordered projection indexes and the corresponding initial points. Finally, the smooth lung contour can be obtained, when the data sequences are trained by the backpropagation neural network model (BNNM). We use the private clinical dataset and the public Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) dataset to measure the accuracy of the presented method, respectively. To the private dataset, experimental results on the initial points which are as low as 15\% of the manually delineated points show that the Dice coefficient reaches up to 0.95 and the global error is as low as 1.47\,{\texttimes}\,10-2. The performance of the proposed algorithm is also better than the cubic spline interpolation (CSI) algorithm. While on the public LIDC-IDRI dataset, our method achieves superior segmentation performance with average Dice of 0.83.},

T1-weighted 1\,mm3 isotropic resolution MR images were acquired for thirty healthy subjects (15 females). Caudate nucleus and putamen were segmented manually by two independent observers and automatically by FIRST and Freesurfer (v4.5 and v5.3). Utilizing manual labels as reference standard the following measures were studied: Dice coefficient (D), percentage volume difference (PVD), absolute volume difference as well as intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for consistency and absolute agreement. For putamen segmentation, FIRST achieved higher D, lower PVD and higher ICC for absolute agreement with manual tracing than either version of Freesurfer. Freesurfer overestimated the putamen, while FIRST was not statistically different from manual tracing. The ICC for consistency with manual tracing was similar between the two methods. For caudate segmentation, FIRST and Freesurfer performed more similarly. In conclusion, Freesurfer and FIRST are not equivalent when comparing to manual tracing. FIRST was superior for putaminal segmentation.},

  abstract = {Parkinson disease is the second-most common neurodegenerative disorder that affects 2--3\% of the population {$\geq$}65 years of age. Neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, which causes striatal dopamine deficiency, and intracellular inclusions containing aggregates of {$\alpha$}-synuclein are the neuropathological hallmarks of Parkinson disease. Multiple other cell types throughout the central and peripheral autonomic nervous system are also involved, probably from early disease onwards. Although clinical diagnosis relies on the presence of bradykinesia and other cardinal motor features, Parkinson disease is associated with many non-motor symptoms that add to overall disability. The underlying molecular pathogenesis involves multiple pathways and mechanisms: {$\alpha$}-synuclein proteostasis, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, calcium homeostasis, axonal transport and neuroinflammation. Recent research into diagnostic biomarkers has taken advantage of neuroimaging in which several modalities, including PET, single-photon emission CT (SPECT) and novel MRI techniques, have been shown to aid early and differential diagnosis. Treatment of Parkinson disease is anchored on pharmacological substitution of striatal dopamine, in addition to non-dopaminergic approaches to address both motor and non-motor symptoms and deep brain stimulation for those developing intractable L-DOPA-related motor complications. Experimental therapies have tried to restore striatal dopamine by gene-based and cell-based approaches, and most recently, aggregation and cellular transport of {$\alpha$}-synuclein have become therapeutic targets. One of the greatest current challenges is to identify markers for prodromal disease stages, which would allow novel disease-modifying therapies to be started earlier.},

  abstract = {The study of brain volumetry and morphology of the different brain structures can determine the diagnosis of an existing disease, quantify its prognosis or even help to identify an early detection of dementia. Manual segmentation is an extremely time consuming task and automated methods are thus, gaining importance as clinical tool for diagnosis. In the last few years, AI-based segmentation has delivered, in some cases, superior results than manual segmentation, in both time and accuracy. In this study we aim at performing a comparative analysis of automated brain segmentation. In order to test the performance of automated segmentation methods, the two most commonly used software libraries for brain segmentation Freesurfer and FSL, were put to work in each of the 4028 MRIs available in the study. We find a lack of linear correlation between the segmentation results obtained from Freesurfer and FSL. On the other hand. Freesurfer volume estimates of subcortical brain structures tends to be larger than FSL estimates of same areas. The study builds on an uniquely large, longitudinal dataset of over 4,000 MRIs, all performed with identical equipment to help researchers understand what to expect from fully automated segmentation procedures.},

  abstract = {Longitudinal image analysis has become increasingly important in clinical studies of normal aging and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, there is a growing appreciation of the potential utility of longitudinally acquired structural images and reliable image processing to evaluate disease modifying therapies. Challenges have been related to the variability that is inherent in the available cross-sectional processing tools, to the introduction of bias in longitudinal processing and to potential over-regularization. In this paper we introduce a novel longitudinal image processing framework, based on unbiased, robust, within-subject template creation, for automatic surface reconstruction and segmentation of brain MRI of arbitrarily many time points. We demonstrate that it is essential to treat all input images exactly the same as removing only interpolation asymmetries is not sufficient to remove processing bias. We successfully reduce variability and avoid over-regularization by initializing the processing in each time point with common information from the subject template. The presented results show a significant increase in precision and discrimination power while preserving the ability to detect large anatomical deviations; as such they hold great potential in clinical applications, e.g. allowing for smaller sample sizes or shorter trials to establish disease specific biomarkers or to quantify drug effects.},

The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.}

Using data from the UK Biobank, we compare the estimates of subcortical volumes produced by two popular software suites: FSL and FreeSurfer. Although most subcortical volumes exhibit good to excellent consistency across the methods, the tools produce diverging estimates of amygdalar volume. Through simulation, we show that this poor consistency can lead to conflicting results, where one but not the other tool suggests statistical significance, or where both tools suggest a significant relationship but in opposite directions. Considering these issues, we discuss several ways in which care should be taken when reporting on relationships involving amygdalar volume.},

  abstract = {Structural hippocampal abnormalities are common in many neurological and psychiatric disorders, and variation in hippocampal measures is related to cognitive performance and other complex phenotypes such as stress sensitivity. Hippocampal subregions are increasingly studied, as automated algorithms have become available for mapping and volume quantification. In the context of the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta Analysis Consortium, several Disease Working Groups are using the FreeSurfer software to analyze hippocampal subregion (subfield) volumes in patients with neurological and psychiatric conditions along with data from matched controls. In this overview, we explain the algorithm's principles, summarize measurement reliability studies, and demonstrate two additional aspects (subfield autocorrelation and volume/reliability correlation) with illustrative data. We then explain the rationale for a standardized hippocampal subfield segmentation quality control (QC) procedure for improved pipeline harmonization. To guide researchers to make optimal use of the algorithm, we discuss how global size and age effects can be modeled, how QC steps can be incorporated and how subfields may be aggregated into composite volumes. This discussion is based on a synopsis of 162 published neuroimaging studies (01/2013--12/2019) that applied the FreeSurfer hippocampal subfield segmentation in a broad range of domains including cognition and healthy aging, brain development and neurodegeneration, affective disorders, psychosis, stress regulation, neurotoxicity, epilepsy, inflammatory disease, childhood adversity and posttraumatic stress disorder, and candidate and whole genome (epi-)genetics. Finally, we highlight points where FreeSurfer-based hippocampal subfield studies may be optimized.},

Cross-sectional and longitudinal estimates of atrophy rates were similar. We also found directional evidence of acceleration in atrophy rates with increasing age in all analyses, with the most marked changes occurring after 70 years of age. This increase in rates after 70 years of age was particularly marked in the ventricles (P\&lt;.001) and the hippocampi (P = .01).We found a significant age-associated decrease in global and regional brain volumes. Some evidence indicates that this decline in brain volumes may be due to a nonlinear acceleration in rates of atrophy with increasing age.

The key is designing a diffusion process on the dataset where the diffusion is done via a small subset called the landmark set. Roseland is theoretically justified under the manifold model, and its computational complexity is comparable with commonly applied subsampling scheme such as the Nystr{\"o}m extension. Specifically, when there are n data points in {$\mathbb{R}$}q and n{$\beta$} points in the landmark set, where {$\beta$} {$\in$} (0, 1), the computational complexity of Roseland is O(n1+2{$\beta$} + qn1+{$\beta$}), while that of Nystrom is O(n2.81{$\beta$} + qn1+2{$\beta$}). To demonstrate the potential of Roseland, we apply it to three datasets and compare it with several other existing algorithms. First, we apply Roseland to the task of spectral clustering using the MNIST dataset (70,000 images), achieving 85\% accuracy when the dataset is clean and 78\% accuracy when the dataset is noisy. Compared with other subsampling schemes, overall Roseland achieves a better performance. Second, we apply Roseland to the task of image segmentation using images from COCO. Finally, we demonstrate how to apply Roseland to explore long-term arterial blood pressure waveform dynamics during a liver transplant operation lasting for 12 hours. In conclusion, Roseland is scalable and robust, and it has a potential for analyzing large datasets.},

This allows the use of tools such as regularization from the theory of (supervised) risk minimization for unsupervised learning. This setting turns out to be closely related to principal curves, the generative topographic map, and robust coding. We explore this connection in two ways: (1) we propose an algorithm for finding principal manifolds that can be regularized in a variety of ways; and (2) we derive uniform convergence bounds and hence bounds on the learning rates of the algorithm. In particular, we give bounds on the covering numbers which allows us to obtain nearly optimal learning rates for certain types of regularization operators. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.},

The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs---30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers---a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Segmentation of human brain structures is crucial for the volumetric quantification of brain disease. Advances in algorithmic approaches have led to automated techniques that save time compared to interactive methods. Recently, the utility and accuracy of template library fusion algorithms, such as Local MAP PSTAPLE (PSTAPLE), have been demonstrated but there is little guidance regarding its reproducibility compared to single template-based algorithms such as FreeSurfer and FSL-FIRST. METHODS Eight repeated magnetic resonance imagings of 20 subjects were segmented using FreeSurfer, FSL-FIRST, and PSTAPLE. We reported the reproducibility of segmentation-derived volume measurements for brain structures and calculated sample size estimates for detecting hypothetical rates of tissue atrophy given the observed variances. RESULTS PSTAPLE had the most reproducible volume measurements for hippocampus, putamen, thalamus, caudate, pallidum, amygdala, Accumbens area, and cortical regions. FreeSurfer was most reproducible for brainstem. PSTAPLE was the most accurate algorithm in terms of several metrics include Dice's coefficient. The sample size estimates showed that a study utilizing PSTAPLE would require tens to hundreds less subjects than the other algorithms for detecting atrophy rates typically observed in brain disease. CONCLUSIONS PSTAPLE is a useful tool for automatic human brain segmentation due to its precision and accuracy, which enable the detection of the size of the effect typically reported for neurological disorders with a substantially reduced sample size, in comparison to the other tools we assessed. This enables randomized controlled trials to be executed with reduced cost and duration, in turn, facilitating the assessment of new therapeutic interventions.},

The resolution of this issue has important implications for the design of therapeutic and investigative strategies. To this end we have used modern stereological techniques to compare the regional pattern of neuronal cell loss in the hippocampus related to normal ageing to that associated with Alzheimer's disease. The loss related to normal ageing was evaluated from estimates of the total number of neurons in each of the major hippocampal subdivisions of 45 normal ageing subjects who ranged in age from 13 to 101 years. The Alzheimer's disease related losses were evaluated from similar data obtained from 7 cases of Alzheimer's disease and 14 age matched controls. Qualitative differences were observed in the regional patterns of neuronal loss related to normal ageing and Alzheimer's disease. The most distinctive Alzheimer's disease related neuron loss was seen in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. In the normal ageing group there was almost no neuron loss in this region (final neuron count in the CA1 region: 4{$\cdot$}40 X 106 neurons for the Alzheimer's disease group vs 14{$\cdot$}08 {\texttimes} 106 neurons in the normal ageing group). It is concluded that the neurodegenerative processes associated with normal ageing and with Alzheimer's disease are qualitatively different and that Alzheimer's disease is not accelerated by ageing but is a distinct pathological process.},

A key contribution is that we propose a method for incorporating longitudinal image information in the learned manifold. In particular, we compare simultaneously embedding baseline and follow-up scans into a single manifold with the combination of separate manifold representations for inter-subject and intra-subject variation. We apply the proposed methods to 362 subjects enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and classify healthy controls, subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Learning manifolds based on both the appearance and temporal change of the hippocampus, leads to correct classification rates comparable with those provided by state-of-the-art automatic segmentation estimates of hippocampal volume and atrophy. The biomarkers identified with the proposed method are data-driven and represent a potential alternative to a-priori defined biomarkers derived from manual or automated segmentations.},

  abstract = {Since its introduction in 2000, Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) has been widely applied in data science. We provide an asymptotical analysis of LLE under the manifold setup. We show that for a general manifold, asymptotically we may not obtain the Laplace--Beltrami operator, and the result may depend on nonuniform sampling unless a correct regularization is chosen. We also derive the corresponding kernel function, which indicates that LLE is not a Markov process. A comparison with other commonly applied nonlinear algorithms, particularly a diffusion map, is provided and its relationship with locally linear regression is also discussed.},

  abstract = {In this article, we are concerned with data generated from a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) experiment. The goal is to parameterize manifold-like white matter tracts, such as the corpus callosum, using principal surfaces. The problem is approached by finding a geometrically motivated surface-based representation of the corpus callosum and visualized fractional anisotropy (FA) values projected onto the surface. The method also applies to any other diffusion summary. An algorithm is proposed that (a) constructs the principal surface of a corpus callosum; (b) flattens the surface into a parametric two-dimensional (2D) map; and (c) projects associated FA values on the map. The algorithm is applied to a longitudinal study containing 466 diffusion tensor images of 176 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients observed at multiple visits. For each subject and visit, the study contains a registered DTI scan of the corpus callosum at roughly 20,000 voxels. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate fast convergence and robust performance of the algorithm under a variety of challenging scenarios.},
