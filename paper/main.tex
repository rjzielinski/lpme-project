\section{Introduction}

Manifold learning describes a set of statistical approaches to modeling high-dimensional data that are assumed to lie along a low-dimensional manifold. These methods have become increasingly popular for medical imaging applications, where assuming an underlying manifold structure is helpful for modeling certain anatomical shapes. In these settings, interacting with a structure in a low-dimensional form may be more intuitive than in a higher-dimensional space. For example, Yue et al. (2016) seeks to compute a parametric representation of the corpus callosum. A number of methods have been developed for manifold learning, including Isomap (Tenenbaum et al. 2000), locally linear embedding (Roweis and Saul, 2000), and Laplacian eigenmaps (Belkin and Niyogi, 2003). Meng and Eloyan (2021) proposed a principal manifold framework that resolved several limitations of previously developed extensions of the principal curves approach introduced by Hastie and Stuetzle (1989).

In many medical imaging situations, understanding how an anatomical structure changes over time could provide meaningful information into the function of that structure, or medical conditions that affect that function. In situations where the structure is better represented by a low-dimensional manifold, interest carries over to understanding how the underlying manifold changes longitudinally as well. 

While the methods given above provide a variety of approaches to retrieving a low-dimensional manifold from high-dimensional data at a single time point, they are ill-equipped to reach meaningful estimates across multiple time points. This is because these methods consider time as an additional dimension in the data, meaning they include time in the dimension-reduction process. This treatment of the time dimension causes time to be incorporated into the low-dimensional parameterization, preventing meaningful interpretation of this dimension. Here, we propose an alternative approach to estimating manifolds over time.

Rather than include time as another dimension in a manifold learning method, we use a process that maintains the interpretability of the time dimension. Specifically, we use the method proposed in Meng and Eloyan (2021) to estimate an appropriate principal manifold at each given time point. We then smooth over these approximated manifolds in the time dimension, yielding an estimate showing longitudinal changes in the underlying manifold.

Some work has been conducted on longitudinal dimension reduction methods, but this research has primarily focused on linear methods, such as the longitudinal principal component analysis approach proposed by Kinson et al. (2019). To our knowledge, the approach to longitudinal smoothing in the manifold learning setting taken in this paper is novel.

The remainder of this article is laid out as follows: In Section 2, we introduce the principal manifold estimation method proposed in Meng and Eloyan (2021). Section 3 discusses how this approach can be adapted for longitudinal settings, and shows the algorithm being used to accomplish this. Section 4 demonstrates the performance of this approach on simulated data. In Section 5, we apply this method to longitudinal data of the hippocampus in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. The article finishes with a discussion of the method in Section 6.

\section{Principal Manifolds and Estimation Algorithm}

The notation below is used to build to a definition of principal manifolds [still need to formally write out]:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Observed data $\left\{x_i\right\}_{i=1}^I \subset \mathbb{R}^D$
  \item Associated latent parameterizations $\left\{t_i\right\}_{i=1}^I \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ [may change this notation to allow for time points]
  \item $C_{\infty}\left(\mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^D\right) = \left\{f \in C(\mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^D): \lim_{\|t\|_{\mathbb{R}^d} \to \infty} \|f(t)\|_{\mathbb{R}^D} = \infty\right\}$ 
  \item $\nabla f$ denotes the gradient of $f$
  \item $\nabla^{\bigotimes 2}f$ denotes the Hessian matrix of $f$
  \item $\|\nabla^{\bigotimes 2}f\|_{\mathbb{R}^{d \times d}} = \left(\sum_{i, j = 1}^{d} |\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial t_i \partial t_j}(t)|^2\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}$
  \item $\|\nabla^{\bigotimes 2}f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^{d})}^2 = \sum_{l = 1}^{D}\|\nabla^{\bigotimes 2}f_l\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^{d})}^2 = \sum_{l=1}^{D}\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\sum_{i,j = 1}^{d}|\frac{\partial^2f_l}{\partial t_i \partial t_j}(t)|^2dt$ represents the total squared curvature of manifold $M_f^{d}$
  \item $\mathcal{K}_{\lambda, \mathbb{P}}(f, g) = \mathbb{E}\|X - f(\pi_{g}(X))\|_{\mathbb{R}^{D}}^2 + \lambda\|\nabla^{\bigotimes 2}f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^{d})}^2$, with $\mathcal{K_{\lambda, \mathbb{P}}}(f) = \mathcal{K}_{\lambda, \mathbb{P}}(f, f)$
  \item A manifold $M_{f^*}^{d}$ determined by $f^*$ is a principal manifold for random $D$-vector $X$ with compact support $\text{supp}(\mathbb{P})$ with the tuning parameter $\lambda$ if \[%
    f_{\lambda}^{*} = \argmin_{f \in \mathcal{F}(\mathbb{P})}\mathcal{K}_{\lambda, \mathbb{P}}(f)
  ,\]%
    where \[%
      \mathcal{F}(\mathbb{P}) = \left\{f \in C_{\infty} \cap \nabla^{-biot 2}L^2(\mathbb{R}^{d} \to \mathbb{R}^{D}): \sup_{x \in \text{supp}(\mathbb{P})}\|\pi_f(x)\|_{\mathbb{R}^{d}} = 1\right\}
    .\]%
  \item $\pi_{f_\lambda^{*}}(X)$ gives a $d$-dimensional parameterization of $X$
\end{itemize}

Given this definition, we now summarize the estimation method provided. This algorithm has three main steps: data reduction, fitting, and tuning. In the reduction step, the HDMDE algorithm is used to summarize the data $\left\{x_i\right\}_{i=1}^{I}$ by points $\left\{\mu_j\right\}_{j=1}^{N}$ with $N \leq I$, and each $\mu_j$ associated with weight $\theta_j$. The fitting stage of the algorithm finds estimated functions 
\[%
  \hat{f}_\lambda = \argmin_f \mathcal{K}_{\lambda, \hat{Q}_N}(f)
,\]%
where 
\[%
  \mathcal{K}_{\lambda, \hat{Q}_N}(f) = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\theta_j \|\mu_j - f(\pi_f(\mu_j))\|_{\mathbb{R}^{D}}^2 + \lambda\|\nabla^{\bigotimes 2}f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^{d})}^2
\]% 
approximates $\mathcal{K}_{\lambda, \mathbb{P}}(f)$. The tuning stage chooses $\lambda^{*} = \argmin_{\lambda > 0}(\mathcal{D}(\hat{f}_\lambda))$, where 
\[%
  \mathcal{D}(\hat{f}_\lambda) = \frac{1}{I}\sum_{i=1}^{I}\|x_i - \hat{f}_\lambda(\pi_{\hat{f}_\lambda}(x_i))\|_{\mathbb{R}^{D}}^2
.\]%

Meng and Eloyan (2021) show that the optimal function will be of spline form. Specific details of the HDMDE algorithm (reduction step) and the PME algorithm (fitting and tuning steps) are given in Meng and Eloyan (2021).

Limitations:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Self-consistency condition means that the model cannot fit to self-intersecting manifolds. This is why partitioning is necessary.
  \item Partitioning approach is somewhat ad hoc and may not work in every situation. In testing it struggled when the structure shape changed drastically, or when orientation was not equivalent. There is not a clear approach to automatic partitioning.
  \item The process of joining the partitions may introduce error.
  \item Algorithm initialization is sensitive to magnitude of change between time points.
  \item Computation time.

	\begin{equation}\nonumber
	\mathcal{K}_{\lambda,\mathbb{P}}(f)=\mathcal{K}_{\lambda,\mathbb{P}}(f,f),

	where $\Vert\nabla^{\otimes 2}f \Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)}^2 = \sum_{l=1}^D\int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \sum_{i,j=1}^d\vert\frac{\partial^2 f_l}{\partial t_i \partial t_j}(t)\vert^2dt$. A manifold $M_{f^*}^d$ determined by $f^*$ is called a principal manifold for $X$ (or $\mathbb{P}$) with the tuning parameter $\lambda$ if 
	\begin{align}\label{def: PM}
	f^*=\argmin_{f\in\mathscr{F}(\mathbb{P})}\mathcal{K}_{\lambda,\mathbb{P}}(f),\ \ \mbox{ where }\mathscr{F}(\mathbb{P}):=\left\{f\in C_\infty\cap \nabla^{-\otimes 2}L^2( R^d \rightarrow R^D):\sup_{x\in supp(\mathbb{P})}\left\Vert\pi_f(x)\right\Vert_{R^d} = 1 \right\}.
	\end{align}

Questions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item What is the best way to evaluate the performance of the estimates? We can use SSD for the embedded values, but how to assess the parameterized values?
  \item Should there be updates to what is defined as the "optimal" model in the PME algorithm? Currently it is possible for a model with non-minimal SSD to be chosen within the fitting of a single tuning value.
  \item Why would we see the SSD increase substantially in late optimization steps?
  \item Are there cases where the SSD and MSD differ substantially? Why would that be the case?
  \item Are there any techniques that help with large amounts of noise in the data? Data reduction should help with outliers, but likely not consistently high noise levels. Early indications that possibly allowing for higher tuning parameters would help?
  \item Why does PME algorithm struggle on Swiss Roll cross-section? It seems to work well up until spiral reaches second layer. The manifold should never intersect, but from the angle from the origin does overlap.
  \item Generally, what are the limitations on the estimated manifolds intersecting? How close can it come to intersecting without showing strange behavior?
  \item Is thin-plate spline computational strategy from Wahba the best approach, or could updated computational approach help (Wood, 2003)?
  \item How much error does the registration process introduce? Can the LPME algorithm successfully handle a certain number of bad registrations or extractions?
